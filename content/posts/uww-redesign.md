What this is:
> I created three drafts in the process of re-designing the [website of one of my sustainability volunteering projects](https://unterwasserwelten.org/) using Affinity Designer, based on a self-created grid.

## The process
There are many ways to go about designing a web page, and one of the most popular tools to get started is the **grid**. 
> In graphic design, a grid is a structure (usually two-dimensional) made up of a series of intersecting straight (vertical, horizontal, and angular) or curved lines (grid lines) used to structure content. [Wikipedia]

For each draft, I created a separate grid in order to see how the grid itself would influence my designs. With the grid in place, I began by distributing key page elements across the page, like the nav-bar, the logo, links to socials, pics (initially inserted as placeholders using the classic cross) and other content. In a very iterative fashion I filled in the various elements with actual content, using my own pictures from past volunteering and some taken from the original site. With pictures and actual text in place, I worked on the typography, added shadows, etc to finish everything up.

## The result
#### Design #1
The grid this design is based one used quite "long" cells (a large vertical dimension), which resulted in quite a hierarchical (top-down!) layout in the end.

#### Design #2
This design has the most "blocky" grid. It used quite big cells, which led to a very blocky and rather simple layout. I like how the typography turned out, especially how the big text on the left has this little play of words using color, placement and semantics.

#### Design #3
This one has the most intricate grid, the one using the smallest cells overall. In my opinion, it also led to the most intricate layout, while the other two led to simpler ones.

## What I learned
Besides diving deeper into graphic design software, I have to say it was very interesting to do this project in such a clear-cut way. Intuitively, I would approach such a challenge in a much more visual, unstructured and direct-into-action way, i.e. starting without a grid or placeholders but rather using actual images directly. However, doing it like this has allowed me to use a classic technique from the visual designers toolbox and sparked ideas and designs that probably would not have turned up otherwise.  
Also, another interesting outcome is how strongly my designs are influenced by the underlying grid, as I described in the result section. Generally speaking, I appreciate every opportunity to approach challenges in new ways and get glimpses into fields that are connected to my own, so that I can understand how it all works and can mediate between parties more easily.
