This post explains how I conducted a summative usability study.

## Idea and Inspiration
The importance of effective collaboration can hardly be underestimated when it comes to ensuring a team's success. However, the communication between its members often remains a challenge. A challenge that lots of different technologies aim to tackle - one of these being project management tools, which strive to make interaction within teams more effective, efficient and satisfactory.   

Two viable options that we wanted to compare to each other are the well known platform *Trello* and its regional competitor *Zenkit*. In order to explore which of the two has the better usability we analyzed both products using a Heuristic Evaluation and then conducted a usability test. Since the usability of every system strongly influences the user's interaction with it, a project management tool's usability is a major factor to consider when it comes to a team's success.

## Process and Outcomes
I recorded the study's entire process from start to finish in a usability test report that I wrote using LaTeX. After a brief introduction, it features a description of all methods used, our expectations, hypotheses and the results complete with a discussion about possible issues of validity.  
The appendix also includes all materials (e.g. the questionaires and tasks used) as well as various UI design suggestions for improvement based on the data gathered.

Since the finished report was kept to 12 short pages (excluding the appendix), I decided not to go into too much detail here.

**To learn more about the process as well as the study's outcome**, visit the **[GitHub repo](https://github.com/manuelsinn/usability-study-trello-zenkit)** or download the (German) report as a pdf **[here](https://github.com/manuelsinn/usability-study-trello-zenkit/raw/master/report.pdf)**.


## Lessons learned
#### General
This project allowed me to dive in head first into the topic of usability. More specifically, I learned to organize my own study from start to finish, which included defining the methods used to gather the data, set up and execute a usability test and evaluate its results qualitatively and quantitatively.

This being a very work and time intensive group project, the experience gained working in a team has also been very valuable.

A lot of thought went into the variables we chose in order to operationalize the concept of usability and its three core pillars effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. This allowed me to get a deeper and more thorough grasp on the topic and the distinction between it and other terms, such as the encompassing field of UX.

#### Thoughts for future development
Although much of the qualitative data gathered is suitable for making suggestions for improvement to the respective UI (as seen in the report's appendix), the study was intended to be summative, focusing on gathering (quantitative) empirical data and evaluating and comparing two finished products. 

Although it was satisfying to work towards and end up with an empirically backed result on which product is superior to the other (within our terms), I want to dive deeper into methods of user-centered design, formative analysis and user research in the future, in order to learn to build something that is relevant to the user's wants and needs right from the beginning.
