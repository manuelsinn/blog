> By visualizing information, we turn it into a **landscape** that you can explore with your eyes, a sort of information map. And when you’re **lost in information**, an information map is kind of useful.  
― David McCandless

True data driven decision making is one of the most important skills in existence, and getting a good grasp of your data is obviously extremely important. This post features some of the various ways I have visualized data so far, including statically designed diagrams as well as fully interactive prototypes.


## Habit Tracking
To get a visual grasp of my habits throughout the year, I designed this diagram:   
[diagram]  
The idea behind this visualisation is taken from the popular GitHub contribution tracker. Every day is represented by a box, the color indicating both the kind (learning Chinese, meditation or working out) and intensity of the contribution (in this case, words studied / time of meditation / time of work out). This way, lots of information is processed in parallel and you get a good grasp of the various tendencies, like the streak of days where the activity was performed, how strongly it was done in general or in certain periods of time, etc. You can even compare week days, weeks and months pretty easily by scanning horizontally, vertically or by group of boxes respectively.

I also designed this diagram:

While it is pretty aesthetically pleasing to me personally, the information it offers at a glance does not compare to the version above. Color in this case only represents the activity, the intensity is given by a line's length or the height of a "bar". It is much more difficult to understand and draw value from, especially since the round shape in this case makes comparisons hardly possible. I included it nonetheless, to illustrate how appearance is obviously not everything. Deep.

## HCI @ University: Overview


TODO
- insert git link to html version of axure prototype
- add explanations for interaction guidelines

- add git-like habit representation
- add the round one too
