### Introduction

This case study shows the process our team used to design a product that helps people have great virtual partys. The Contextual Design method was used to guide ourselves through every aspect of UX, from user research over design iterations to a low fidelity prototype that combines all the insights we gained.  
As one of the four team members I was an active part of each stage in the process. Additionally my role as project leader was to ensure that the team's progress was on track and there was good communication inside of the team as well as towards the client.  

Read on to learn more about our systematic way of solving this design challenge. The case study includes the problems we faced and the solutions we came up with, as well as UX deliverables like affinity diagrams, identity models, and prototype iterations.

# The problem
The pandemic forces individuals around the globe to stay in and isolate themselves. Creative ideas and work-arounds have sprung up to keep up the spirits between social distancing measures. One of these is the rise of virtual parties: people come together online, celebrate, play games, listen to music and enjoy the company that is becoming a sparse commodity. 

Our mission was to design a low-fidelity prototype that helps to make this experience a better one. To keep the development process centered around the user, we used Karen Holtzblatt's **Contextual Design** method.


# Gathering & Consolidating User Data
## Contextual Inquiry
In order to build up empathy and understand the wants and needs of the user we started the design process with qualitative user research.  
This meant that each of the team members conducted their own contextual inquiry, an in-depth and on site interview where the user guides the interviewer through the task at hand. Our goal in each of these inquiries was to acutely listen to the user's needs. To build a product that would satisfy the user in the end, we needed to find out what they are really trying to say and tease out what they are trying to do that they cannot do (yet).  
Somewhat interestingly, there were hardly any virtual parties being hosted in the team's social network - so we needed to create our own.

#### Challenges and Solutions
1. The first challenge that came up was **being the host of the party** and, at the same time, the interviewer. This meant that we were in the role of bringing everyone together without actually participating in the party.  
We solved this issue by making clear in the beginning that we would be in the background and, from time to time, take a little time out with the interviewee every now and then.

1. Half of the team members' interviews were done on-site, the other half remote. While the on-site ones were no different from the method's usual procedure, it was clear that **doing the contextual inquiry remotely** meant we needed to find ways to overcome problems imposed by the physical distance.  
One way we solved this was through establishing an additional channel of communication just for the interview. In my case this meant that the subject and myself were part of the party video call on Zoom, but also had a complimentary WhatsApp video call over our phones. This way I could easily give my subject a signal to mute ourselves on the party channel and switch over to the interview channel to talk privately and without interrupting the flow of the party. Doing this on our phones also made it possible to show each other around the room and view sketches made on paper.

1. Another issue was the way the questions and interruptions could **change the social dynamic** during the party setting. To keep this as little an issue as possible we used the above described setup and decided to concentrate on observing and asking questions in bulk when talking to the interviewee alone.

1. **Mistaking oneself for the user** is a general challenge for every product design team. This is especially the case when there is strong overlap between the product's user and the designer, just like in this instance. It is easy to make **unchallenged assumptions** about the reasons a subject acts a certain way, even more so when that subject is a friend.   
To prevent this, we made it a point to discuss with the user any hypotheses we had about their reasons and intentions. Another way to moderate the issue would have been to interview subjects outside of our own social networks, but due to project scope and resources that unfortunately was not an option.
