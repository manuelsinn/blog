# give context and intro
explain that this is a case study with challenges etc

give context: set expectation for reader and tell them whether its relevant or useful to them
name of product, service, client, capacity (freelance ,in house), role



include ux deliverables, show systematic way in which you approach solve design challenges

include iterations, insights and iterations again



# The problem
The pandemic forces individuals around the globe to stay in and isolate themselves. Creative ideas and work-arounds have sprung up to keep up the spirits between social distancing measures. One of these is the rise of virtual parties: people come together online, celebrate, play games, listen to music and enjoy the company that is becoming a sparse commodity. 

Our mission was to design a low-fidelity prototype that helps to make this experience a better one. To keep the development process centered around the user, we used Karen Holtzblatt's **Contextual Design** method.

In a few words: 
This includes conducting qualitative user research in order to build up empathy and understand their needs and wants.

# Planning & Considerations
- party size? awkward mit zu wenig/zu vielen Leuten? Gruppen aufspalten?
- festlegen was gemacht wird? offen lassen? rahmen setzen? tanz, spielen, quatschen, trinken, was anschauen, ...


# Gathering & Consolidating User Data
## Contextual Inquiry
We started the design process with the qualitative user research. This meant that each of the team members conducted their own contextual inquiry, an in-depth and on site interview where the user guides the interviewer through the task at hand. Our goal in each of these inquiries was to acutely listen to the user's needs. To build a product that would satisfy the user in the end, we needed to find out what they are really trying to say and tease out what they are trying to do that they cannot do (yet).
Somewhat interestingly, there were hardly any virtual parties being hosted in the team's social network - so we needed to create our own.

#### Challenges and Solutions
1. The first challenge that came up was **being the host of the party** and, at the same time, the interviewer. This meant that we were in the role of bringing everyone together without actually participating in the party.  
We solved this issue by making clear in the beginning that we would be in the background and, from time to time, take a little time out with the interviewee every now and then.

1. Half of the team members' interviews were done on-site, the other half remote. While the on-site ones were no different from the method's usual procedure, it was clear that **doing the contextual inquiry remotely** meant we needed to find ways to overcome problems imposed by the physical distance.  
One way we solved this was through establishing an additional channel of communication just for the interview. In my case this meant that the subject and myself were part of the party video call on Zoom, but also had a complimentary WhatsApp video call over our phones. This way I could easily give my subject a signal to mute ourselves on the party channel and switch over to the interview channel to talk privately and without interrupting the flow of the party. Doing this on our phones also made it possible to show each other around the room and view sketches made on paper.

1. Another issue was the way the questions and interruptions could **change the social dynamic** during the party setting. To keep this as little an issue as possible we used the above described setup and decided to concentrate on observing and asking questions in bulk when talking to the interviewee alone.

1. **Mistaking oneself for the user** is a general challenge for every product design team. This is especially the case when there is strong overlap between the product's user and the designer, just like in this instance. It is easy to make **unchallenged assumptions** about the reasons a subject acts a certain way, even more so when that subject is a friend.   
To prevent this, we made it a point to discuss with the user any hypotheses we had about their reasons and intentions. Another way to moderate the issue would have been to interview subjects outside of our own social networks, but due to project scope and resources that unfortunately was not an option.

## Interpretation Session
- a lot of sequential info without the *why*


### Joy in Life Models
- work together with affinity notes to offer a 360° view of the activity and the user (only choose ones that are relevant)
- day in the life (accomplishment), identity, relationship & collaboration model (connection) to gather data on cool concepts and enhance UX

### Joy in Use Models
- sequence models
- decision point models
- physical model
- artefact models

### Remote Interpretation 
Miro etc

### Conclusion
- 48h nach CI, immer im Team
- produkte: 
1. user & organisation models
2. affinity notes (50-100 pro Interview)
3. ausgewählte CD models (2!)
--> Rundumsicht der Tätigkeit
- Am Ende Hauptergebnisse zusammenfassen



## Data Consolidation
Consolidating and Condensing User Models --> Creating Immersion Experiences through Communication Design

Meaningful Structure + story language = way in + interaction with data --> product more based on data & user!
--> not only documentation, also communication!

### Affinity Diagram 
--> Karen Holtzblatt Quotes!!
- worum geht's wirklich? kein keyword matching! --> *was ist die implikation fürs design?*
gruppen von notes entstehen induktiv, nicht durch vorgefertigte kategorien

blauen notes fassen *alles* der gelben zusammen, bringen es auf den punkt. bottom up! gelb -> blau -> rot -> grün
--> manager können top down lesen 

"ownership of a part is a problem, not a goal"


important: show process, how much time, how many team members, what did we do, what challenges and problems did we face and how did we overcome them!
